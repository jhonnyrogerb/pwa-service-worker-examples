- [App Shell Cache](https://simple-pwa-wcouwbjvdp.now.sh/pages/app-shell/) - It precaches the app shell resources in a versioned cache. An application shell (or app shell) refers to the local resources that your web app needs to load the skeleton of your user interface (UI) [Source](https://google-developer-training.gitbooks.io/progressive-web-apps-ilt-concepts/content/docs/introduction-to-progressive-web-app-architectures.html).

- [Offline First](https://simple-pwa-wcouwbjvdp.now.sh/pages/offline-first/) - It precaches the app shell resources in a versioned cache, and maintains another cache that's populated at runtime as additional resources are requested. If a resource is cached and available offline, return it first before trying to download it from the server. If it isnâ€™t in the cache already, download it and cache it for future usage [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Offline_Service_workers#Offline_First).

- [Online First](https://simple-pwa-wcouwbjvdp.now.sh/pages/online-first/) - It maintains a cache that's populated at runtime as additional resources are requested and serve the resource from the cache only when the user is offline or a network error occurs.

- [Offline First Update](https://simple-pwa-wcouwbjvdp.now.sh/pages/offline-first-update/) - Similar to the "Offline First" but the resource is updated in the cache on each request.
